*Boost high schoolers critic learning*

#### In a nutshell

[YLE](https://yle.fi/), Finland's national public-broadcasting company, released a new set of APIs created to let developers to have access to the huge historical database of Finnish public TV and radio broadcasts. I participated in a team of four to design a new service targeting young generations. My main support to the team was in the activities of initial research; prototype design; and user testing. After an intense research and design process the team presented Curio, a system to help teachers and students to support the learning process.

#### The project

YLE’s project was a great challenge for many reasons. Firstly, it was asked to develop a service that could be connected to APIs created by YLE. The APIs facilitate the connection to YLE’s public media database. Furthermore, YLE was particularly interested to improve its services for teenagers because, based on previous researches, 12-18 year old is the smallest age segment that uses YLE’s networks. Any kind of innovative product would be welcome from the company. This huge research space was a great opportunity but in the same time a difficult task. 

#### The developing

The first big challenge was to find the right problem which the team would work around in order to develop an useful service. We followed a very popular design strategy, the double diamond. Firstly, we collected a lot of information, defined few promising user segments, and generated a lot of ideas about the possible services. Then, we narrowed the bouquet of solutions by testing ideas with potential users and determining the problem definition. Consequently, we started to develop possible solutions and test them until we defined the service.

The following step was to generate several concept candidates. All the concepts were presented with simple sketches that I made (["Sketch for User Experience"](https://books.google.it/books?isbn=0123819598) is a great book that helped me a lot in this task with practical tips). The research narrowed to one concept that more promising than others, a system to support teacher and students for homework and other study activities via the possibility to tag contents on YLE’s archive and other web resources.

###### The use of fast sketching helped to develop a large number of ideas and fast testing them with users at an early stage of the process

A business strategy was developed in parallel to to the user research. It was important to identify the best business strategy to make the service sustainable from the financial point of view. Among the others, it was analysed the revenue model and used some business tools such the business model canvas (BMC), the value proposition canvas (VPC), and the SWOT analysis.

After that, we focused more on the product design. We used the acquired data from the users to develop personas and scenarios, explore the service and get a more clear idea about the functions to implement. We focused to identify few flows of use and use them to set up a first prototype of the service to test with few users. The prototype was a very basic sequence of static screens made with Adobe Illustrator. We both showed that on screens or printed on paper for a ["Wizard of Oz"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment) prototype. We validated the concept with interviews with students and teachers.

###### A very simple static prototype made with Adobe Illustrator helped to validate the concept with the students. The advantage of a prototype based on vector images is that it can be easily modified and used as base in further steps with interactive prototypes

-----

In a further iteration of the project, we developed a interactive prototype with the software InVision. The advantage was the possibility to show the prototype in an intuitive way directly on the screen of smartphones. This was very useful because we understood that while students find more natural to interact with a mobile version of the service, teachers prefer a web version of the app to upload and check the assignments.

###### An interactive prototype on mobile helped the team to understand the different approach to the service of students and teachers

-----

With an additional test with teachers and students, we understood that the main focus of the activity of tagging information on the web was not about to facilitate the execution of the student studies. The real interest for students and teachers was to understand if the tagged information was relevant to the study topic and at which degree. We understood that users were focusing on the reliability of the information rather than the organisation and the presentation of the information itself. Based on this data, we pivoted the direction of the project and we focused and adjusted the design of the prototype as a service that teach media criticism and critical thinking. This approach had a very positive feedback from the users. The project was presented at YLE at this stage of development.

#### The team

The team consisted of four people. One expert in business and marketing took care mainly on the design of the business side of the project and the coordination of the the presentations  during the meeting with the client; two engineers were in charge of the technical part and helped during the research.

#### My contribution

My main position was UX researcher. During the project, I designed in concert with the other members of the team. In particular, I reviewed the structure of the interviews; got the feedback from the users; analysed data; drew and sketched to help the definition of the concepts; coordinated the design of personas and scenarios; designed the prototypes with Adobe Illustrator and Invision.
