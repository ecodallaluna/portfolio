*A mobile App to support nurse training*

#### In a nutshell
In a team of four I designed and performed an usability test of Ach So! by LeGroup. Ach So! is a mobile App for the creation of annotated video tutorials for training purposes.

The alpha version of Ach So! was created and tested with construction worker teams in Germany. Following that, the development team had the opportunity to test the service for nursing training at the Metropolia University in Helsinki. The App was delivered without adapting it to the new context of use. The first feedback from Metropolia was positive as the teaching staff and the nursing students wished to use more Ach So! during their training activities. However, many small issues were notified. For this reason LeGroup asked an usability test of the App in the specific context of nursing training.

###### Ach So! was originally developed for construction workers, but it was tested in beta release in a nurse training context

#### The developing
The usability test was performed on the pre-release version of the App to discover issues in the specific use context of education required to become a nurse. The usability test was designed to test specific functions and activities with the App. Firstly, a series of interviews and a focus group were organised to collect information about the use of the App from the teaching staff and the student nurses that were already using the App. It was a seen to be a useful research. It was discovered that the way that the App was used during the training process was different from the idea that the developer had about the use of Ach So!. The App was designed in a way to create video tutorials with instructions. However, the training nurses were using the App to record their own version of the taught techniques, to share them with other students and check with the instructors for the quality of the procedure. Rather than a tool to record video instruction, the training nurses were using Ach So! as a tool to record, study and share their own personal performance on specific tasks.
Based on this initial information, as a team we designed a test on specific tasks. The previous usage of the App could be a confounding variable because expert users could have found strategies to overcome potential usability problems. For this reason we recruited the participants from a pool of student nurses that had never used the app before. Based on the first interview sessions, a set of tasks were designed to test the main functions of the App. Following this, a test session was performed in simulation rooms at Metropolia.

###### The test was set in the same location of the nurses training to facilitate the task and make the participants feel relaxed in a familiar place

-----

The test was designed in a fairly standard way. A UX researcher asked the participants to perform the tasks while a second researcher was assisting by taking notes of the performance of the participants and writing down usability issues and other problems that emerged during the test. The participants were asked to perform the tasks while thinking aloud. The second researcher was taking notes about important usability issues during the test. This information was cross examined a second time with a video recording of the test.
The usability test did not uncover big problems about the use of Ach So! This was also predicted because the App was in an advanced stage of development and as such the major usability problems had already been fixed. However the test resulted in a list of small usability issues and some specific problems related to the specific context of use. The results were reported in a document and arranged in order of the type of problem and severity of encumbrance.

###### Suggestions about how to improve the design of the App in further versions. Text and sketches were included in the final usability report presented to the company

#### The team
The team consisted of four people. Two UX experts, an engineer and one researcher in mathematics. Due the higher skill in the usability area, the work was directed by the other UX expert and I, but everyone contribute with their own skills.

#### My contribution
I focused in the expert usability research by planning the analysis and the frameworks used for this task. I also had a major role in the design of the research with users.
