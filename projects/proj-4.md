#### In a nutshell
In a team of two I helped the [Semantics and Knowledge Innovation Lab (SKIL)](http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/innovazione/archivio/jol-skil-trento.html) of [Telecom Italia](http://www.telecomitalia.com/) to understand better how users interact and utilise Second Nose, a mobile air sensor developed to create maps of the quality of air around the city.

Second Nose is a project developed by SKIL to monitor the quality of air via a small Bluetooth device connected to smartphones. Users can check the quality of the air around them and data from all the participants is collected in an anonymous way to create a map of the quality of the air around the city.

###### The Alpha Version of the App had a very rudimentary user interface. The Second Nose team needed a comprehensive user research before to move to the next developing step

-----

The SKIL team is centred mainly on the accumulation and elaboration of Big Data. For this reason, at the time that I started to be involved in the project, Â the group of software developers had not focused on the usability of the system. Very little functionality was implemented for the end users, and many questions were raised when the developing team decided to have a first feedback from the users.

#### A two-birds-with-one-pebble user research
The developing team asked for contrasted results. From one point of view it requested answers to specific questions and problems about the user experience with Second Nose, on the other hand the team wished for a broad comprehension about the usage of the service. We designed a research that tried to answer to both.

###### The research focused on the use of the App but some time was reserved to study the interaction with the device and the use strategies developed by the participants

-----

Firstly, we created a model about how users interact with the device. This model was really rough, and it was based on informal chats with users, interviews with the product manager and the developing team. We realised that the majority of the information about the service was based on assumptions. Another problem was the strategy to develop the research. The developing team wished to collect a lot of information about the use of the App, however the access to users was really limited in time and the number of participants. 
We proceeded by collecting all the requests from the developing team, the project manager, and other stakeholders of the project. After that, we grouped all the questions in themes, and organised them in order to identify the most urgent ones to answer. We then performed one-to-one interviews with a dozen users. We asked questions in order to collect information about the use of the service. We used simplified personas and scenarios to deliver the interview in a narrative way and help users to explain what they do with Second Nose and why they do it in their way.

###### Scenarios and personas were useful to help to explain the prospective functions in a narrative way and collect the opinion of the participants

-----

After the analysis of this qualitative data, we delivered a report about the use of the App. We had a further meeting with the developing team and the product manager and discussed the insight collected with the research. The data was comparing that with the initial list of questions. This helped to create a list of accurate questions. We designed a questionnaire based on these questions and distributed it to the majority of the test user of Second Nose (120 people).

The questionnaire was based on close-ended questions with few open-ended questions based on a summarised scenario that was shown to be useful during the first qualitative research. The result of the questionnaire confirmed some data from the qualitative report while some initial insight was contradicted. 

#### Further investigation in Asia 
The research had an international development with a further investigation on the field that brought me to visit Thailand, South Korea and Japan. The research was promoted by the University of Trento as part of an international exchange programme.

###### The research had an international development with the collection of opinion about air pollution in several countries

-----

The investigation was developed in order to analyse the perception and the awareness of air pollution, and to understand if a product like Second Nose would be attractive in different markets. It was a challenging experience that made me interact with local translation teams and deal with problems like validation and translation of standardised questionnaires in different languages and cultures. The collected information was analysed and compared with the real quality of the air from the World Health Organization (WHO) to have a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena.
