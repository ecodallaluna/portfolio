#### In a nutshell
In a team of two I helped the [Semantics and Knowledge Innovation Lab (SKIL)](http://www.telecomitalia.com/tit/en/innovazione/archivio/jol-skil-trento.html) of [Telecom Italia](http://www.telecomitalia.com/) to understand better how users interact and utilise Second Nose, a mobile air sensor developed to create maps of the quality of air around the city.

Second Nose is a project developed by SKIL to monitor the quality of air via a small Bluetooth device connected to smartphones. Users can check the quality of the air around them and data from all the participants is collected in an anonymous way to create a map of the quality of the air around the city.

###### The Alpha Version of the App had a very rudimentary user interface. The Second Nose team needed a comprehensive user research before to move to the next developing step

-----

The SKIL team is centred mainly on the accumulation and elaboration of Big Data. For this reason, at the time that I started to be involved in the project,  the group of software developers had not focused on the usability of the system. Very little functionality was implemented for the end users, and many questions were raised when the developing team decided to have a first feedback from the users.

#### A two-birds-with-one-pebble user research
The developing team asked for contrasted results. From one point of view it requested answers to specific questions and problems about the user experience with Second Nose, on the other hand the team wished for a broad comprehension about the usage of the service. We designed a research that tried to answer to both.

-----

###### The research focused on the use of the App but some time was reserved to study the interaction with the device and the use strategies developed by the participants

-----

Firstly, we created a model about how users interact with the device. This model was really rough, and it was based on informal chats with users, interviews with the product manager and the developing team. We realised that the majority of the information about the service was based on assumptions. Another problem was the strategy to develop the research. The developing team wished to collect a lot of information about the use of the App, however the access to users was really limited in time and the number of participants. 
We proceeded by collecting all the requests from the developing team, the project manager, and other stakeholders of the project. After that, we grouped all the questions in themes, and organised them in order to identify the most urgent ones to answer. We then performed one-to-one interviews with a dozen users. We asked questions in order to collect information about the use of the service. We used simplified personas and scenarios to deliver the interview in a narrative way and help users to explain what they do with Second Nose and why they do it in their way. 

-----

###### Scenarios and personas were useful to help to explain the prospective functions in a narrative way and collect the opinion of the participants

-----

After the analysis of this qualitative data, we delivered a report about the use of the App. We had a further meeting with the developing team and the product manager and discussed the insight collected with the research. The data was comparing that with the initial list of questions. This helped to create a list of accurate questions. We designed a questionnaire based on these questions and distributed it to the majority of the test user of Second Nose (120 people).

The questionnaire was based on close-ended questions with few open-ended questions derived from a summarised scenario that was shown to be useful during the first qualitative research. The result of the questionnaire confirmed some data from the qualitative report while some initial insight was contradicted. 

#### Further investigation in Asia 
The research had an international development with a further investigation on the field that brought me to visit Thailand, South Korea and Japan. The research was promoted by the University of Trento as part of an international exchange programme.

###### The research had an international development with the collection of opinion about air pollution in several countries

-----

The investigation was developed in order to analyse the perception and the awareness of air pollution, and to understand if a product like Second Nose would be attractive in different markets. It was a challenging experience that made me interact with local translation teams and deal with problems like validation and translation of standardised questionnaires in different languages and cultures. The collected information was analysed and compared with the real quality of the air from the World Health Organization (WHO) to have a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena.

-----

#### Second Nose Redesign
After the deep investigation of users’ relationship with Second Nose, I used information from the previous qualitative research to design a new set of personas and scenarios that summarises the collected information about user’s needs.

-----

###### A new set of personas and scenarios was used to summarise and present the infomration collected from the research

-----

To bring the design of Second Nose to the next level, I used personas to role playing the scenarios. Which are the users’ goals? How can the app helps to reach them? I wrote down step by step the actions performed in different scenarios and summarised them in several User Flows.

[comment]: <> (Add here image user flow, image to do)

Following that, I sketched mock-ups of the product’s interface for each scenario and overlapped them. Little by little it appeared a structure of the desired function and a map of the different sections of the app. This was completed with suggestions from the developing team about required technical information (e.g., user identification and connection to network functions).

###### Early sketch of the App functions and connection based on User Flows

----- 

This was a process with several iterative sessions. Each one led to a more detailed map of the app. The technique used to develop the map evolved as well, from cheap draws to more sophisticated interactive mock-ups. Yet, this was not a linear process. The procedure guided to several branches used to explore different ideas, and many of them did not lead to useful solutions. The maps were designed in strong connection with the project manager, the developing team, a selection of users, and other stakeholders. All these figures added useful suggestions and examined the proposed solutions.

-----  

This approach is based on actual user activities, and it drives to a structure of the app that is user-centred.

###### App Map based on the user-centered research

-----  

As part of the design process, I completed several tasks that are not related directly to the UX design of the App. For example, I suggested to the developing team to create a Product Architecture Map. This helped to share a high level understanding of the technical functions of the service. Key figures like stakeholders and project manager were able to understand better how the App and other parts of the system communicate to each other and the users. I also helped the business and marketing team to develop Business Model Canvases and Value Proposition Canvases focusing on the UX prospective.

###### Some research that I have to complete as UX researcher is not directly connected to users. For example, I helped the developing team to design this Product Architecture Map that communicates the structure of the service to other figures involved with the project

####A deeper investigation about the Air Quality Display
Big concern was raised by the design team about how to display the level of pollution perceived by the Second Nose sensor. The original idea to use the EPA color standard is conceptual wrong, because the sensor cannot show accurate readings, and EPA schematic colours show a range of reading that is too wide for the typical experience of SecondNose’s users.

-----

###### One of the last mock-ups with the EPA-style display. This solution encountered many issues and it was abandoned during the design process ([here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecodallaluna/portfolio/master/assets/img/projects/proj-4/ssecondnose_menu_navigation.png) a copy in higher resolution)

-----  

After discussing about the problem with the design manager and the developing team, I split the problem in two different design researches: shape and colour.

Firstly, I probed which kind of visual metaphor was optimal to show the air pollution information. This was done with an initial brainstorming with representatives of the developing team, other stakeholders and the project manager. The best solutions were tested with a samples of 40 users via a questionnaire designed by myself. The questionnaire uses pair of words based on [Microsoft Desirability Toolkit to Test Visual Appeal](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microsoft-desirability-toolkit/) to investigate the level of attraction to the different solutions. A draft of the questionnaire can be found at [this link](https://goo.gl/forms/ptn810IItSYRMQ5S2). The result did not show a clear preference from the users and a further investigation with few direct interviews showed that none of the visual metaphors were clearly understood.

----- 

It was decided to do not use a visual metaphor to represent the level of the pollution but to focus on a chromatic scheme. The developing team suggested to consider three level of discrimination of the quality of air (“Good”, “Acceptable”, “Bad/Dangerous”) based on the level of sensibility of the algorithms developed by the back end functions of the system. I designed different solution with interface mock-ups. The chromatic scales were designed based on different metaphors, eg, the color of the traffic light (green-yellow-red), the color of the sky that get polluted little by little (from azure to grey), and a combination of quiet/alarm based of correlation between colours and emotions (for example Ou et al., 2004, and Zentner, 2001) blue-purple-red. The different solution were tested with semi-structured interview with a small selection of users, developers and stakeholders. The latter solution receive a clear appreciation from the testers.

Further grounded theory analysis of the qualitative data from the interview shows a pattern in the perception of the pollution from the interviewees. Pollution is associated with objectives as dark, dirty, dusty, spiky; while clean air is associate to light, pure, refreshing, round. This made me resonate with the maluma/takete effect (firstly introduced by Köhler in 1929, for a useful summary see Rogers & Ross, 1975). I used this concept to visualising the pollution effect with a round shape that becomes spiky when the level of pollution increases.
