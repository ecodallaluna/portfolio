*Discover the role of Medical Imaging in Treatment Decision Making*

#### In a nutshell
Medical imaging are a wide class of visual documents, for example scans from magnetic resonance (MRI), x-rays, and ultrasounds. They are fundamental tools to diagnose diseases, communicate between medical experts and plan medical interventions. However, these kind of images can be difficult to read and their use is confined to experts.
[Elekta](https://www.elekta.com/) is a Swedish company that produces machines for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. The company supplies some NHS hospitals in England and it was interested in understanding if medical imaging would be a useful tool in the interaction with patients. Furthermore, the approach in treatment decisions in cases of diseases with complex treatment options like cancer is changing. The main opinions of the medical community and the guidelines of NHS are pushing to a major involvement of patients and their family in decisions regarding the medical treatments.

#### The project
Can these new images be useful for patients in treatment decision making? If so, in which way? I developed a research based on qualitative investigation methods to answer to these questions. This research aimed to collect information in the early stages of product development.

#### The developing
The research focused on two sources; the opinions of the doctors and the opinions of the patients. The opinions of the doctors were collected during one-to-one interviews with specialists in the treatment of different categories of cancer (prostate, bowel, and breast cancer). Undeniably, patients have a much more emotional approach when speaking about their diseases, so a different data collection approach was used. In this case, it analysed a database of 1000+ diaries of patients. Both sources were analysed with a [Grounded Theory approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory) by using software for the analysis of qualitative data (ATLAS.ti).

###### Transcript of interviews with doctors and diary entries from patients were analysed following a Grounding Theory approach

The main themes that emerged from the analysis were organised in an Affinity Diagram. Other research techniques were used for the analysis, for example a modified version of the Customer Journey to create a “Patient Journey”, and the Customer Profile Map from the Business Model Canvas in order to identify user’s problems and needs.

###### Techniques borrowed from marketing theories (Customer Segment from the [Value Proposition Canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas)) were used in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the user experience

-----

The results showed that doctors prefer not to use images during the treatment decision process when the patient is involved. Some other techniques are preferred, like the use of sketches and a good rhetoric. Furthermore, patients look less interested in the use of images during the treatment decision making. However, interesting insight was discovered by analysing the journey of patients throughout the disease. There are some points in the journey of patients when the use of medical images can be effective, especially in the moment when the diagnosis is confirmed and after the treatment. These moments are also the ones that are more emotionally involving for the patients.
