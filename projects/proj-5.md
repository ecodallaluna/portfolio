*Improve babies’ most precious time*

**Code and extended description can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ecodallaluna/sleepyhead) of the project**

#### In a nutshell
During the last years there has been a rising interest for smart systems that are able to monitor the condition of newborns. Modern baby monitors collected several negative feedbacks. In particular, it looks that their ability to sense the breathing and the heartbeat are far away to be accurate, and many models of baby monitor generate false alarms. These alarms are very stressful for both parents and children. Moreover, a subdue and dangerous false feeling of security can lead the parents to do not check babies carefully when sensors are not triggered often. In a team five, we decided to analyse a real situation, a young family with a baby. According to the information given by the family and a paediatrician, we realised that the most important information required to improve a baby’s quality of life is the humidity of the head. A baby with wet head can easily suffer from strong migraine. We realized a  prototype composed  by two elements: a pillow with sensors and a sculpture to keep in the living room. The pillow analyses children’s conditions, while the sculpture shows the gathered information in the living room with a dance of water, lights and colours. This solution is elegant and displays baby’s condition to the parents in an innovative and emotional way.

###### Concept drawing of the initial stage of developing. With the collaboration of a couple of parents, we were able to analyse the problem and test a prototype directly with one newborn

#### The developing
The first step in the development of the project was to collect more information to understand better the problem. We interviewed a couple of parents and a paediatrician. Furthermore, we performed an extensive research on academic literature. We understood that the key factor to ensure the wellness of a newborn is the humidity of the skin, especially the humidity of the head. We also learnt that current commercial baby monitors do not consider this parameter as important, so we decided to experiment on an interface that helps parents to understand the condition of the baby by using this piece of information. 

Defined the problem, we explored different utilisation scenarios and discussed them with a family of a newborn, the users that were participating to the research,. We found that the most promising scenario is to help parents to monitor babies in the time after dinner before going to sleep. During that time parents need to take care of house chores or they want to relax a little, and they would enjoy to have a system that helps them to monitor the baby without the need of a constant checking of the baby’s condition. We also defined that while during that time the parents spent mostly of the time in the living room or in the kitchen, the baby rest in a bedroom. We needed to develop a solution that considers these factors, and we started to develop a wireless system that connects bedroom and living room.

Many solutions were proposed. We experimented several type of sensors for the detection of the discomfort of the baby (e.g. microphone, motion sensor, galvanic skin reaction, etc.). Furthermore, we considered different reactions to the detection of the discomfort, for example automatic motion of the cradle or baby carousel toys, and a notification system to the parents. At the end, for safety reason we decided to implement a simple passive detection of the discomfort with a temperature and humidity sensor. The temperature was used as security trigger to be sure that the sensor was positioned correctly under the head of the baby, while the reading of humidity gave a measure of the discomfort.   
 
After several tests, we set the design of the sensor-enchanted pillow and a first prototype of the display for the living room. The display was made with simple material like plastic and corrugated cardboard. We tested the prototype with users to adjust design and sensor reading. Based on the feedback from the users, the second prototype utilised coloured lights to transmit information about the wellness of the baby, while the initial notification with streaming water was used only to request an immediate action from the parents.

###### It was needed several iterative sprints to improve the design of the prototype and to adjust the sensor reading

We tested the second prototype with the initial family and collected their opinion with a semi-structured interview. The feedback was overall positive, especially the sound of the alarm generated from streaming water. Users considered this feedback less stressing compared to the alarm sound made from traditional baby monitors. However, the review of the prototype stressed the limited viability that such a system can have in a real deployment.

###### The second version of the prototype presented several improvements due the feedback from the users

#### The team
The team was composed by two software developed, two engineers and one expert in UX research.
 
#### My contribution
As main expert in UX, I helped to design the initial research and test the prototype. I also had a major contribution in the developing of the software and the hardware of the prototype.
